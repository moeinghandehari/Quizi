 *
 * ```
 * @Destination(
 *      route = "profile",
 *      deepLinks = [
 *          DeepLink(
 *              uriPattern = "https://myapp.com/$FULL_ROUTE_PLACEHOLDER"

 *      ]
 * )
 * @Composable
 * fun ProfileScreen(
 *      id: String
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * Since the `ProfileScreen` has an argument (`id`), the final uriPattern
 * used will be `"https://myapp.com/profile/{id}"`
